new uBoot commands:

led in[it]			setup GPIOs
led ge[t]			get button status
led se[t] hh		set LEDs to lower 4 bit
led se[t]			increment last state, i.e. make LEDs count
led mi[rror]		read button status and mirror to LEDs until a key is pressed
led bl[ink]			blink LEDs

lcm in[it]			initialize subsystem (DSS, GPIOs etc.)
lcm ba[cklight] dd	set backlight level (0..255)
lcm po[wer] dd		set power level (0..2)
lcm on				set lcm on
lcm of[f]			set lcm off


To be Done:

gps on | of[f]		control GPS receiver (and initialize UART)
gps re[ad]			read GPS NMEA from UART until a key is pressed

tsc init			initialize/enable TSC2007 through I2C2
tsc get				read current ADC values (incl. internal temp and AUX/photosensor)
tsc lo[op]			read x/y coordinates
tsc ch[oose]		somehow allow to define receptive fields and use the result to select different boot options

can uBoot load bitmap files from the boot-partition directly to the framebuffer of the LCM?

if yes:
a) load splash.bmap screen from MMC while waiting to break into uBoot console
b) load menu.bmap background image (so we can use icons etc.) and combine with 'tsc choose' to provide a simple but nice boot-menu


General ToDo:

integrate/rebase on official uBoot as soon as the patches by Khasim are approved.
